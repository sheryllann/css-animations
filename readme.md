# CSS Transitions & Animations

## Objectives

- Understand keyframe animation
- Use CSS Transitions to animate elements
- Use CSS Animations to create detailed animations
- Describe the importance of prefixing CSS properties
- Compare & contrast using CSS and JS for animations

## Intro (5 minutes)

So far, we've used JavaScript and jQuery to make elements move around on our page. While easy to do, using JavaScript to animate our page will slow our page load times down in noticiable ways. It can also be messy to mix cosmetic code in with the core of your frontend functionality.

Luckily, CSS Animations allows us to handle animations where they belong - in the stylesheet! CSS Animations also have a much lower impact on page loads. 

## Concept (10 minutes)

CSS uses the same basic concepts used in hand-drawn animation - Keyframes:

![Keyframes!](http://www.utdallas.edu/atec/midori/Handouts/history_files/key_n_inbetween.jpg)

In the above image, the the left and right drawings are **Keyframes** - they define the starting or ending point of a smooth transition. The drawings between the left and right image are **Inbetweens** - they don't have to be drawn on a storyboard, because the animator can assume what will  happen inbetween keyframes.

In web-based animations, Keframes work the same way - the represent the begining or ending state of the element being animated. However, our Inbetweens will be generated by code, instead of filled in by hand later.

Let's take a look at the starter code in this repo. You'll find some beautifully designed CSS attached to the index file, greeting you with a nice message. But there's a second design hiding in our file, that we can't yet see! We have to add the class .alt first.
Let's use a jquery toggleClass click function to add/remove the class on click:

```javascript
	$( "#greeting" ).click(function() {
	  $( "#greeting" ).toggleClass( "alt" );
	});	
```
Now clicking on the greetings div will toggle between the two CSS styles. But, there's no animation - its more like a flipbook, right?

That's because these two class states represent our keyframes. What we have right now is kind of like watching a storyboard instead of animated movie - we get the idea, but its not much fun to watch.

So now that we have Keyframes, how do we generate our inbetweens? With CSS, there's a few different ways.

## Transitions (10 minutes)

**Transitions** let us tell the browser how to change a property over time. Let's add a new property to the #greeting CSS:

```css
	transition: all 2s ease;
```

**Transition** is the name of the CSS property. It tells the element to try to animate certain values if it can.
**All** means, 'try to animate ALL property values'. This could also be replaced with specific properties, like width or color.
**2s** is the amount of time you'd like the animation to take - in this case, 2 seconds.
**ease** is the "Speed Curve" of animation - basically, a tweak to the math of how long the animation takes to produce more realistic animation effect. Ease, for instance, starts slow, speeds up around the middle, then slows down at the end -  giving the impression of "weight" in the animation. This part of the value is optional - if left out, it defaults to "ease". 

Now let's reload and check out our animation - way smoother! Feel free to play with the transition values until you find a speed and transition you like.

You'll notice that some properties animated their transition, while others didn't - for instance, our background color transitioned beautifully through the color spectrum, but our font-family simply toggled into the new font. That's because font-family can't be animated - its way to complex for a browser to figure out on its own. However, while there are some values like font-family that can't be animated, you'll find that most cosmetic properties can be.


## Keyframe Animations (10 minutes)

But why stop there? We can go further!

**Animations** are similar to transitions, in that they let us have properties
change over time, but they give us more control over how those changes happen.
For example, we have more control over how the animation repeats, change between
multiple values at once, etc.

To keyframe animate a CSS element, we need two components - the animation structure itself, and then a call to the animation with specific instructions.
Let's write a keyframe animation that will make our greeting bounce:

```css
	@keyframes bounce {
		0% {
			position: relative;
			top: 0px;
		}
		50% {
			position: relative;
			top: -120px;
		}
		100% {
			position: initial;
			top: 0px;
		}
	}
```
Here, we're able to see our keyframe sturcture even more clearly - they're broken up by percentages, 100% being the complete duration of the animation (we'll set the specific timing in our animation call). We can add as many keyframes as we want, and as few as two (0 and 100%). At each point, we can specify a new set of css properties. 

While we could go nuts and add all sorts of property changes in here, I would encourage you to think of Keyframe Animations the same way you would JS prototypal functions - they work best when they are clear, simple, and extensible. Our 'bounce' animation serves a single function - to bounce an element. By keeping it style-neutral, we allow ourselves to use the animation on lots of different elements.

Now that we have a basic animation set up, let's call it on our #greetings element:

```css
	#greeting.animated {
		animation-name: bounce;
		animation-duration: .5s; /* or: Xms */
		animation-iteration-count: 10;
		animation-direction: normal; /* or: alternate, reverse */
		animation-timing-function: ease-out; /* or: ease, ease-in, ease-in-out, linear, cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2) */
		animation-fill-mode: forwards; /* or: backwards, both, none */
		animation-delay: 0s; /* or: Xms */
	}
``` 
The above call runs the animation as soon as the class .animated is added to our element (if we wanted a delay, we could adjust animation-delay). We start by calling the animation by its name - bounce. We tell it how long to take in animation-duration. In fact, there's so many animation options, I would encourage you to look them up and use whatever properties make the most sense for you:

[http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation-direction.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_animation-direction.asp)

As a final step, let's add our new .animated class to our click function so we can test it out:

```javascript
	$( "#greeting" ).toggleClass( "animated" );
```

Wow! That's . . . interesting. It's bouncing alright, but it doesn't look very natural. Maybe there's some more CSS properties that can help . . .

## Transforms (10 minutes)

**Transforms** allow you to rotate, skew, and pivot your HTML elements in 3D space! While you'll still be rendering your result on a 2D canvas - your computer screen - you can still move your object around like it were a physical object. This is both exciting and terrifying, as the CSS tranform property has [almost 2 dozen unique value types](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transform.asp).





**Prefixing** - If you're using chrome, you won't need to prefix any properties
for this lesson, but in general, it's a good idea to check [Can I Use](caniuse.com)
to see if you need to use prefixes to support most users. For CSS Animations,
you should use prefixes to ensure support for Safari, IE, and other browsers.

The easiest way to do this is with [prefix free](http://leaverou.github.io/prefixfree/).

### CSS / JS Animations

CSS Animations are easy and mostly compatible, so they're often a good choice
for basic animation needs. For anything more complex, such as animation that
depends on user input, you'll need to use Javascript. There are good libraries
for animation, including jQuery UI, and [GSAP (Greensock Animation Platform)](http://greensock.com/gsap)
